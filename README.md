To use this app, download the source code above by clicking the Code button and download the packaged file.

Open Visual Studio Code, and make sure your Explorer tab is on (if not, in the Visual Studio Code,  go to View->Explorer), then drag all the files into the the Explorer tab.

Once all the files are in the the Explorer tab, right click on the package.json and select "Open in Integrated Terminal"

With the Terminal on the bottom of the Visual Studio Code screen, run the command "npm install webpack", followed by "npm start"

If you have not set up Visual Studio Code to open HTML files with your default browser, you may download an extension to open HTML files with your default browser:

Once you have installed the extension, right click on index.html to open the HTML page in your default browser that resembles this page: https://company-dex.netlify.app/

You may test the app by clicking on the Create Record button on the top right of the screen. 

You may also edit or remove the default contact list from the Home page.

Errors should have been found during the installation process. If you've made it this far, the app should be working just fine
